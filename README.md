Semester Project

Brief Online: Adventure Trails Hikes website

Adventure Trails Hikes is a new business offering extreme hiking in a number of different countries. It offers supervised hikes, ranging from short day tours to weeklong treks, with camping. The service is aimed at college-educated professionals (men and women) between the ages of 18 to 35.

The focus is not just on the experience of nature but also the specific nation's culture and traditions. Hike experiences will typically include traditional meals, music/theatre, as well as contact with the local population. Additionally, the emphasis is on sustainable, environmentally behaviour and respect for the local culture.

The website should promote some of the hikes, and could have a monthly/daily focus on a given country/region. Maps, photos, package prices and travel details should be included.

You have been provided media assets in the form of text and images (see link under Resources). It is for you to decide how these will be used, in terms of presentation, hierarchy, and design.
